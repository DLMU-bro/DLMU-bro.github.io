At the time of writing this blog post, our group has not settled on the specific theme of the graduation project. We had an offline meeting with our advisor, Ting Zheng. We came up with a lot of interesting ideas through brainstorming at the meeting, but we didn't decide on the theme of our graduation project in the end.  

However, this meeting was really deeply affecting. The teacher's words inspired me that graduation design does not need to be very complicated, and wonderful small designs to solve life problems can also be the best solution.
> **We used the blog template created by Mr.Anderson, and subsequent blogs will change from it**


## Our first meeting recording

In our meeting, we decided on two general directions, mountaineering aid machinery and library book return system. These two topics are more in line with our ability level, and meet the graduation design standards. Our graduation project probability will be selected in these two topics:
* **mountaineering aid machinery**
* **library book return system**

## Images

These are some of the pictures we took during the meeting. Since I am not a professional photographer, these pictures may look amateurish.

## How to built this blog

The creation of this blog is more about my own learning and exploration. I'm not sure if GitHub can directly modify the blog template, so I figured out a set of ways to make a blog and record it.

What we need are:
* gem
* ruby
* Node js
* atom

After the environment is installed and configured, fork the template to GitHub and clone it to atom for modifications.Specific tutorials are available on the B website, and CSDN will solve many of your problems.
